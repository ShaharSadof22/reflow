# Reflow Examples
Here you'll find a few examples for Reflow usage.\
It's important to mention again that the usage of React as the views implementation is a matter of choice and not forced by the general Reflow library.

#### Examples
[simple-to-do](./simple-to-do) - A basic introduction to Reflow, with (what else but a) To-Do app. This is an in-browser app with two simple views.\
[phone-book-app](./phone-book-app) - Demonstrates two major aspects of Reflow - Separation between flows and views, and multiple flow invocation.\
[multilang](./multilang) - Demonstrates the usage of the translation system in reflow, and how displayed strings can change without re-updating every single view.\
